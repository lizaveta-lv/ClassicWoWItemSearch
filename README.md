# Classic World of Warcraft Item Search

This project uses ReactJS and Battle.NET API to create a simple search application for MMORPG World of Warcraft Classic items.
You can try it for yourself at https://lizaveta-lv.github.io/WoWClassicItemSearch/
The code will NOT be available publically since it contains Battle.NET API-related sensitive information but can be shared at request (e-mail liashovae@gmail.com for access).

## Known issues:
- No item icon (that part of Battle.NET API is down since March 2023 at least)
- No details view (in progress)
- No search filters (in progress)
